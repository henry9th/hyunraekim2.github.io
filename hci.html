            Our team decided to tackle the issues that a bar and its customers faces. Some of these issues are the difficulty of verbally
          ordering at a crowded bar, effectively making complicated orders, and waiting time for bars without servers. </div>

              <li>
                  <p> Assuming that most customers will have a drink or two, we implemented large buttons with images for

           <h4 class="subheading mb-2">The Process: &nbsp Design &nbsp | &nbsp Development</h4>
          <div class="mb-5">
              Before even beginning to design, the group sat down to brainstorm the purpose of a bar app. We chose a bar simply
              because it was interesting without considering the different needs for a bar app. Our first meeting was dedicated
              to coming up with a POV and determining what features our app needed without any designing. The work was divided in terms of features and each member had a different
              part of the app to develop. <br></br>

              <img class="mb-4" src="./img/pov.png" style="width:400px;height:210;"/> &nbsp <br/>


              Our group, mostly having previous Android experience, chose to use Android Studio to design the app instead of using an app
              design software. However, being a 5-person project, we faced many issues with project configuration and version control.
              In addition, we faced many issues when it came to making small design changes, most notably increasing the cart icon on
              the toolbar. However, our group met up on many occassions for hours at a time to overcome the complications. <br></br>

              On our second meeting, we continued to discuss and answer key questions for the app. What were our target customers?
              What are the main needs we are fulfilling? What are the different design considerations that need to be made?

              On our third meeting, we drew out a storyboard of the app. Once again, we divided up the work to develop. Our fourth and final meeting
              was to address the fact that each of our pages did not have a cohesive theme or styling. We came together and made both style and
              intuitive changes to each of the pages. <br></br>

              <img class="mb-4" src="./img/sb-1.png" style="width:252px;height:188px;"/> &nbsp
              <img class="mb-4" src="./img/sb-2.png" style="width:252px;height:188px;"/> &nbsp
              <img class="mb-4" src="./img/sb-3.png" style="width:252px;height:188px;"/> &nbsp
              <img class="mb-4" src="./img/sb-4.png" style="width:252px;height:188px;"/> &nbsp

              <br>
              Overall, while we did develop outside group meetings, we worked mostly in a group meeting room. This way, we always had
              more than one pair of eyes on each page, leading to conversation and suggestions for improving the design. Also, dealing
              with merge conflicts in-person was key.

          </div>

          <h4 class="subheading mb-2">Finally...</h4>
          <div>
            Overall, I think this was one of the most capable and hard-working group I've worked with for a school project. Each member
            was dedicated to making high-quality work. In addition, the group was always open to meeting and working together. Looking back
            now, I think we overcame some considerable hurdles simply because we worked together. Thanks to everyone! <br></br>

            I do think using a design software could have cut a lot of time that could be used to build other features and be more ambitious
            with our designs. Otherwise, I am satisfied with how the prototype and the presentation/video turned out.

              We asked each approximately 10 quesitons regarding their current health routine, whether they are looking to improve the health routine, what stops them from
              improving their health routine, their thoughts on running, and what make them find running more interesting. Below is a video compilation of key responses.

              <p class="mb-3">For the speed dating stage, we brought back our same interviewees and showed them our storyboards along with our idea for the app.
                The general feedback that we would get is that the idea was good and that they would be interested themselves in using the app. The only repeated
                criticism we received was regarding how they would run wearing a holokit, but our intended use case would regard the app being integrated with a
                pair of sports glasses/goggles.

                Can't say too much about this portion of the process other than that Kevin and Michael did an awesome job working with Unity.
               </p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="subheading mb-2">My Contributions</h4>
            <div class="mb-5">
              <p class="mb-3">
                As a team, we were split into two teams. One for the ideation, empathy, and presentation and the other being the development team.
                For this project, I took a step back from development and was part of the first team. In addition to everything our team did, I
                was tasked with compiling together the interview videos and the prototype demo videos.
               </p>
            </div>

          <h4 class="subheading mb-2">Finally...</h4>
          <div>
            Again, I got to work with a very capable team. Everyone had a role which best suited their strengths. For example, our two developers Kevin and Michael
            had previous experience with Unity, allowing them to efficiently develop a prototype that aligned with our results from ideation. Despite a busy schedule
            for each of the members, we were successfully able to finish the project without too much strain on any member, and I think that in itself is a large
            accomplishment. In terms of the app that we created, I believe that the app would be the extra push for me to go running. However, there are many improvements and features that can be
            added such as having pre-made routes, difficulty ratings, and other crowdsourcing-based features. Of course, there needs to be improvments on AR technology
            and also a more seamless integration of the app in the forms of glasses, but overall, the prototype showed a good example of what our aims were.

         <p class="mb-3">We were able to talk to a few HKUST students who were on campus during typhoon. The insight from exchange students was especially useful due to the fact
           that many of the exchange students didn't have close friends within the dorm early in the semester. In addition, it was their first typhoon that they've experienced.
           We asked the simple questions such as what the general experience was like for them, what they did during the typhoon, and what could have improved the experience.

        <h4 class="subheading mb-2">Brainstorm</h4>
        <div class="mb-5">
          <p class="mb-3">We organized our thoughts using a mind-map. Focusing on the main situation, we came up with key needs of the user during a typhoon and then we began to think of features that could help serve these needs. We then came up with examples of implementations of these features.  </p>

        <h4 class="subheading mb-2">Storyboards</h4>
        <div class="mb-5">
          <p class="mb-3">We created three storyboards for each of the main features that we wanted to implement to demonstrate the intended use case and functionality. You can see the exact feature on the mindmap for reference. </p>

        <h4 class="subheading mb-2">Prototyping</h4>
        <div class="mb-5">
          <p class="mb-3">
            I was unfortunately away on a trip during the prototyping period. However, from what I know, the work was well distributed with each person being
            responsible for different features. The team faced obscure issues when developing and testing on Pepper, but in the end were all able to film a working
            demo of the feature.

        <h4 class="subheading mb-2">My Contributions</h4>
        <div class="mb-5">
          <p class="mb-3">
            My contributions include the ideation process and coming up with storyboards. In addition, I was also primarily responsible for creating the presentation and presenting.
           </p>

      <h4 class="subheading mb-2">Last thoughts...</h4>
      <div>
        This time around, we took an early start on the project due to the fact that some of the members in the group were traveling during the weekends including myself. As a result,
        the whole process was quite smooth with each member contributing in the process. We finished ideation the first week, prototyping the second, and the presentation on the third week.
        In terms of Pepper, I think we realized it's limitations throughout the assignment and our excitement working with it faded quickly over time. However, it was an experience
        that doesn't come around often so I'm thankful getting to work on this assignment with my teammates. Thank you for a good semester of HCI.
